        <h1>Welcome to the Game!</h1>
        <p>In this game, you'll make decisions that affect various factors such as economic growth, crime rates, and pollution levels. Your goal is to balance these factors while managing a budget.</p>
        <p>Instructions: In this task, you play a "gambling" game. You need to choose one of the 4 buttons (A, B, C, or D) with you mouse.
Each time, you have the opportunity to win some money, but you may also sometimes have to pay a fee to the government. After each trial, you need to collect your money, which will adjust your total funds.
You start with a loan of $2000.
There are 100 trials (~5 minutes in total).
Go on until the game stops and see how much you can make on top of the loan of $2000.
Press the space bar to start. Good luck! </p>
